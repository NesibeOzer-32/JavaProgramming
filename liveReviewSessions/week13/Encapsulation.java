    pıq(populer interview question): How dou you implement this OOP concept?
    1.Make all or necessary fields/variables/attributes private access modifier.
    2.Getter and Setter methods we reach the fields and do some action(read,writeing, using the field.)
    3.We dont reach the fields directly, we reach through some conditions
    4.WE will use this concept at Singleton Driver Concept
    5.Salary field(condition for setting the field), retrive your username that you have forgatten
    from an application, getter method for userName might need your email.
    6.CONDİTİON part is not necessary,depends on your cod senerio


    Concepts is Coding: they encounter a problem, until some genious finds a general solution

    When you are learning a new topic: Consider this question first--Why did they need create this

    OOP CONCEPTS WE WİLL LEARN
    Encapsulation
    Inheritance
    Abstraction
    Polymorphism

***Write Only Classes:
   ----Only have setter method for that field

***Read Only Classes:
    *****How do you use OOP concepts in your(testing) framework?--Cucumber Freamework
    ----Only have getter method for that field: Lodin Class UserName field is read-only, immutuble(String)
                                                                                         Mutation:Channging
